    <h1>Infotrope Control Protocol Specification</h1>

    <p>This document describes the internal control protocol between the meta server and the actual ACAP server. It's only spoken across a socketpair, thus security wasn't any kind of concern, and extensibility was not a goal.</p>
    
    <p>The protocol is line orientated, and violently simplistic. It's very easy to abuse.</p>
    
    <p>Every message begins with a single octet command name, and a space. The rest of the line depends on what the command name was, and I'll call the the payload:</p>
    
    <p><code>
	line = command SP payload LF
	command = %x00-FF
	text-char = ; Pretty much any printable ASCII character.
	num-char = "0"-"9"
      </code></p>
    
    <p>Some commands will be sent expecting a nearly instant response - where this is the case, the real ACAP server thread that sent the command will be blocking. In general, this'll be the Master-helper thread, so during the CP call, sockets won't get closed. Worst case - where the metaserver fails to provide a return code - is that the real server doesn't close connections.</p>
    
    <p>In practise, a command is always an upper-case character. Commands currently include:</p>
    
    <dl>
      <dt>L</dt>
      <dd><p>Log</p>
	<p><code>
	    log-payload = log-pri SP *( text-char )
	    log-pri = num-char
	  </code></p>
	<p>Logs via whatever logging mechanism we have, at this priority. This really means syslog, or would if I got around to it.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>E</dt>
      <dd><p>Fatal Error</p>
	<p><code>
	    fatal-payload = *( text-char )
	    </code></p>
	<p>Also logs, but also exits the metaserver when the child process quits. This is used for unrecoverable errors - such as when the ACAP server cannot actually start up properly - where a restart won't work. Think of it as a warning that the child's about to crash.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>S</dt>
      <dd><p>Socket Request</p>
	<p><code>
	    socket-payload = family SP family-specific
	    family = 1*(num-char)
	    ; Denote the address family. Note that the type we want is always SOCK_STREAM.
	    family-specific = ipv6-addrinfo / ipv4-addrinfo / unix-addrinfo
	    unix-addrinfo = "unix" SP 1*( text-char )
	    ipv4-addrinfo = "ipv4" SP ipv4-addr SP tcp-port
	    ipv6-addrinfo = "ipv6" SP ipv6-addr SP tcp-port
	    ipv4-addr = 1*3( num-char ) "." 1*3( num-char ) "." 1*3( num-char ) "." 1*3( num-char )
	    ; ipv4 dotted-quad notation address, possibly "0.0.0.0" for INADDR_ANY
	    tcp-port = 1*5( num-char ) "/" tcp
	    ; TCP port address.
	    ipv6-addr = 1*( num-char / ":" )
	    ; dead::beef notation IPv6 address.
	  </code></p>
	<p>Requests the metaserver to listen to this IP address, and pass the socket back to the caller via an Ancillary Message of type SCM_RIGHTS. Remember that the real ACAP server runs as a non-priveleged user, and thus cannot do this for itself. It also has the benefit that on restart, the metaserver simply hands across existing listening sockets.</p>
	<p>Right now, incidentally, only ipv4 works.</p>
