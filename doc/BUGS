ACLS
====

Use Cases:

1) No inheritance:

Generally, want datasets with no inheritance to have $owner rights in full.

2) Inherited, writable:

$owner rwix

Specifically, we want to have all rights other than a where rights are granted.

Thought:

How about tying rights tightly to a value? This would suggest that storing an ACL on an attribute which is not overridden would be rights-checked on the ACL in effect in the parent, not in the local, thus preventing the ACL stuff.

Hmmm...
